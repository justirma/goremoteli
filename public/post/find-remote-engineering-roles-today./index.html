          <p>I&rsquo;ll be covering 2 big topics to help you find and land your next Remote Engineering role.</p>

<p>The first is understanding how to best showcase that you&rsquo;re open and ready to work in a remote work environment. Secondly, I&rsquo;ll show you a few sites that have truly worked for friends in the past to find and at least get an interview for a remote role.</p>

<h2 id="building-and-starting-to-showcase-your-remote-experience">Building and starting to showcase your remote experience</h2>

<p>Here are few ways to <em>spin</em> remote work experience and showcase it if you&rsquo;re applying for a job that requires remote experience:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>You have worked with a remote team before</strong> - this one is obvious. If you have this experience you&rsquo;ll probably be solid from the remote work front if a company requires it. This can be in the form of a full-time role or a contract gig where you were not in the same physical space as the rest of the team.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Your local company has let you work from home a few days a week</strong> - this is remote work experience right here! Working from home 2-3 times a week while the rest of your team either remains in the office or is similarly working remote, you still had to encounter a lot of the work style, communications, and asynchronous responsibilities as a full-time remote worker.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>You&rsquo;ve developed a product with a team that was spread across timezones</strong> - another great way to spin remote work. Communicating and developing a product in a non-physical space is difficult and if you&rsquo;ve done this before you have some of the chops to say that you have remote work experience.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-to-look-out-for-while-looking-at-job-descriptions">What to look out for while looking at job descriptions?</h2>

<p>These are a few core things you should look out for:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Product</strong> - ensure that you have some interest in the product and users the company targets. You don&rsquo;t want to lose interest after landing the job and end up quitting because of it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Soft skills</strong> - we know that the hard skills are pretty straightforward but take a look at the soft skills mentioned in job descriptions. It can truly help with crafting your resume, cover letter, introduction to mention a few of the soft skills the company is on the search for.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Remote experience</strong> - if a company doesn&rsquo;t have</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>MUST HAVE REMOTE WORK EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>in their job description, this could mean it&rsquo;s not a top priority. So, if you&rsquo;re coming from a background with little remote work exposure these are good roles to look out for as you may have a higher chance of getting an interview even though you have no remote work experience.</p>

<p>Good luck! If you need specific help, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out.</p>
