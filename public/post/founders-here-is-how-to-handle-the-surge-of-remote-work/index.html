              </h2>

              <p>
                If you’re a startup founder or you’re a hiring manager whose
                company has held a physical office with no remote employees,
                it’s sorta time for you to think about why this is. As the wave
                of millennials starts breaking and changing the workforce (for
                the better) there are going to major changes in the way
                on-boarding, job descriptions, inclusion, communications and
                more start to evolve.
              </p>

              <p>I mean, we’re seeing it right now</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Gallup’s
                  <a
                    href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx"
                    >State of the American Workplace Report</a
                  >
                  concluded that 43% of employees work remotely at least some of
                  the time. And among those who work remotely at least part of
                  the time, the percent of employees who work remotely 100% of
                  the time is now 20%, up from 15% four years prior.
                </p>

              <p>
                This is HUGE. The more access technology brings the faster we’re
                going to see emerging and rising demand for opportunities that
                allow folks to have:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>flexible scheduling</li>
                <li>autonomy</li>
                <li>PTO</li>
                <li>no commute</li>
                <li>freedom</li>
                <li>settings that allow for optimal productivity</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                So, if you know of a company that is not keeping up with the
                trend of remote work or maybe you are someone who’s trying to
                figure out the space of remote work so that you can start
                exposing your teams to it.

              <h3 id="here-are-my-actionable-suggestions">
                Here are my actionable suggestions:
              </h3>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Take a step back</strong>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Pull up your employees, document their responsibilities,
                      interactions with co-workers, and communications with
                      customers - can any of these roles be done from home?
                      That’s it. 1 simple question to ask yourself. Can all of
                      the roles at my company be done from anywhere where this
                      is solid internet connection? If you have a digital
                      product, the answer is most likely, yes.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Educate</strong>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      No team can be built without ground-work and attention.
                      Remote work has been around for a bit and some companies
                      have somewhat perfected what it looks like to manage and
                      structure a fully functioning remote team. Some of my
                      favorites are,
                      <a href="https://remote.co/company/buffer/">Buffer</a> and
                      <a
                        href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/"
                        >Gitlab</a
                      >. Read through the docs and share your findings with your
                      team. Find what progress and successes did these companies
                      make by having a fully remote team? Let me tell you, a
                      ton. Why? Because the setting where you work doesn’t take
                      away the effort, intelligence and thought behind executing
                      work.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Start with 1 employee or 1 team</strong>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      When I first started working remotely I was the first
                      in-office employee to go off and start working remote from
                      another location 1,000 miles away from HQ. Starting with 1
                      allows companies to experiment, document and
                      course-correct as they work to define expectations of
                      having remote employees.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                These 3 suggestions are suggestions. But those that commit to
                doing all three, starting right now are way ahead of the game.
